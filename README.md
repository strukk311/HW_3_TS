1 - Create an async function with a known response shape (Promise generic), use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts - iterate over them and for each post and append them to the DOM as new nodes

2 - Create a function updateObjectInArray.ts - which has to update an object of a given shape in an array of uni-shaped objects and return a cloned array. (the function has to be called as updateObjectInArray(initialArray, keyToFind, keyValueToFind, patch)), where initialArray is the initial array (you should clone it before performing the update), keyToFind is the key value of which is known to you (id, for example), keyValueToFind is the value of that key, known to you, patch is the update that need to be applied (has a Partial interface)
